There is no code here for part one as I didn't actually write any code for it.
I just realised that the velocity of the projectile going into the ground when it is at y=0 for the second time is equal to it's starting y velocity plus one. Therefore the maximum velocity must correspond to (the absolute value of the minimum y position) - 1.
To find the maximum height, I simply used the sum for a linear series function: (n^2 + n ) / 2
